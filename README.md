6 Key Macropad:

Feel free to use/modify the files to make your own macropad!
Including all PCB files and CAD files for the case. I will upload an awesome photo of the project when it's complete!

# Firmware/QMK/VIA support
Use zadig to install the WinUSB drivers onto the Atmega32u2
Use qmk msys to compile the .hex file to flash onto the MCU
Use qmk toolbox to flash the MCU (to turn the MCU into bootloader mode, press the reset switch on the back of the PCB)

# PCB/Build Files
For manufacturing files (ie gerber files) see the manufacturing folder
